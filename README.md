üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Dependencies
Framework: Node.js (CommonJS), Express.js

AI Engine: OpenAI SDK (gpt-4o-mini)


Database: MongoDB via Mongoose ORM 

Deployment: Render

Security: Secure CORS Whitelisting (only allows access from the Vercel Frontend domain).

üí° Core Logic: LLM Reasoning
The primary function of this API is to process a user goal and break it down into actionable steps. This satisfies the project objective to use AI reasoning for task breakdown.

Prompt Engineering and Schema
The API uses a specialized prompt to ensure the output is strictly valid and structured JSON.

Prompt Component	Purpose
LLM Model	gpt-4o-mini
Instruction	
"Break down this goal into actionable tasks with suggested deadlines and dependencies." 

Output Schema	Enforced JSON array of objects, ensuring each task includes task, deadline, and depends_on.
